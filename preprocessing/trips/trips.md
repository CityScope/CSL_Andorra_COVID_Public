# Trips

The daily number of trips are computed based on precomputed stays data.

## User trips 
The number of daily trips for each subscriber was computed as their daily number of stay points minus 1, since a new stay point is recorded when a subscriber moves beyond a 200m radius.

## Users making trips
The number of users making trips each day is also computed as the number of unique subscribers with more than 0 trips.

## Total trips
Total trips per day is the sum over all users' trips that day.

## Mean and median trips
Computed as the average daily trips per user.
